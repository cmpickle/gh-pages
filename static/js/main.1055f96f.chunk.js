I began my journey in the software world writing C++ to control Arduinos and was enveloped by the thrill of getting it do what I wanted. I went from the guy who had never written code before to the top of the class because I loved spending time writing code!\n\nI have a passion for constantly learning and stretching myself. I love that software engineering is like a constantly evolving puzzle that I get to learn and adapt to in order to make cool new things faster and with higher quality. I enjoy learning about code, learning best practices, and learning new coding tools. My only complaint is that there isn't enough time in the day to learn everything that I want to!\n\nI started out with Java and C# and ended up enjoying the Microsoft world. I learned about design patterns and became obsessed with writing clean, scalable, and maintainable code. After a while I fell into the world of web development learning Angularjs and React. I took a heavy liking to React and started to learn Go. I then learned about DevOps where I have set up robust scalable deploy processes using docker and Kubernetes and dove into big data with messaging in Kafka and searching with Elastic Search as I continued to branch out and explore the fascinating world of software development. I have worked across many industries including enterprise content management, planning, contact center, automotive, advertising, financial, and dance. I also tend to have a bad habit of becoming the leader of all the teams I work with.\n\nAt home when I am not wake surfing, 3D Printing, automating my home, or reading I like to get in some more coding. I have worked on many personal projects and side projects over the years. I have had fun making Android apps and games, Unity games, scripts and utilities for my personal life and for my family, and as some of my side projects I have built a full dance payment and registration system and a financial advisor lead generator and distributor software.",flairs:[{path:"assets/images/tech/github.png",alt:"C#",link:"https://github.com/cmpickle"},{path:"assets/images/tech/stack-overflow.png",alt:"SQL Server",link:"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1758235/cmpickle"},{path:"assets/images/tech/linkedin.jpg",alt:"Selenium",link:"https://www.linkedin.com/in/cameronpickle/"}]}},o.a.createElement("a",{href:"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1758235/cmpickle",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},o.a.createElement("img",{src:"https://stackoverflow.com/users/flair/1758235.png?theme=dark",width:"208",height:"58",alt:"profile for cmpickle at Stack Overflow, Q&A for professional and enthusiast programmers",title:"profile for cmpickle at Stack Overflow, Q&A for professional and enthusiast programmers",style:{border:"5px solid rgb(0, 136, 255)",borderRadius:"5px",margin:"40px"}}))),m.companies.map(function(e){return o.a.createElement(c,{key:e.id,company:e})})))}}))});Boolean("localhost"===window.location.hostname||"[::1]"===window.location.hostname||window.location.hostname.match(/^127(?:\.(?:25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)){3}$/));var w=Object(i.createMuiTheme)({typography:{useNextVariants:!0},palette:{type:"dark"}});s.a.render(o.a.createElement(i.MuiThemeProvider,{theme:w},o.a.createElement(f,null)),document.getElementById("root")),"serviceWorker"in navigator&&navigator.serviceWorker.ready.then(function(e){e.unregister()})},52:function(e){e.exports={companies:[{id:5,name:"Rakuten",image:"assets/images/rakuten.png",position:"Senior Software Engineer",timeline:"August 2019 - Present",technology:"Go, React, Vue, GCP, Docker, Kubernetes, postgres, mysql",description:"I worked on a project during which I was working with React for the front end and Go for the backend.
