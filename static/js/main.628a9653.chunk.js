Me",description:"For me, Software Engineering is a way of life.\n\nOriginally I planned on being an Electrical Engineer but quickly found that I was obsessed with Software and the problems that I could solve with it (Although I still do enjoy some good hardware work now and again). I began my journey in the software world writing C++ to control Arduinos and was enveloped by the thrill of getting it do what I wanted. I went from the guy who had never written code before to the top of the class because I loved spending time writing code!\n\nI have a passion for constantly learning and stretching myself. I love that software engineering is like a constantly evolving puzzle that I get to learn and adapt to in order to make cool new things faster and with higher quality. I enjoy learning about code, learning best practices, and learning new coding tools. My only complaint is that there isn't enough time in the day to learn everything that I want to!\n\nI started out with Java and C# and ended up enjoying the Microsoft world. I learned about design patterns and became obsessed with writing clean, scalable, and maintainable code. After a while I fell into the world of web development learning Angularjs and React. I took a heavy liking to React and started to learn Go. I then learned about DevOps where I have set up robust scalable deploy processes using docker and Kubernetes and dove into big data with messaging in Kafka and searching with Elastic Search as I continued to branch out and explore the fascinating world of software development. I have worked across many industries including enterprise content management, planning, contact center, automotive, advertising, financial, and dance. I also tend to have a bad habit of becoming the leader of all the teams I work with.\n\nAt home when I am not wake surfing, 3D Printing, automating my home, or reading I like to get in some more coding. I have worked on many personal projects and side projects over the years. I have had fun making Android apps and games, Unity games, scripts and utilities for my personal life and for my family, and as some of my side projects I have built a full dance payment and registration system and a financial advisor lead generator and distributor software.",flairs:[{path:"assets/images/tech/github.webp",alt:"Github",link:"https://github.com/cmpickle"},{path:"assets/images/tech/stack-overflow.webp",alt:"Stack Overflow",link:"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1758235/cmpickle"},{path:"assets/images/tech/linkedin.webp",alt:"LinkedIn",link:"https://www.linkedin.com/in/cameronpickle/"}]}},r.a.createElement("a",{href:"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1758235/cmpickle",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},r.a.createElement("img",{src:"https://stackoverflow.com/users/flair/1758235.png?theme=dark",width:"208",height:"58",alt:"profile for cmpickle at Stack Overflow, Q&A for professional and enthusiast programmers",title:"profile for cmpickle at Stack Overflow, Q&A for professional and enthusiast programmers",style:{border:"5px solid rgb(0, 136, 255)",borderRadius:"5px",margin:"40px"}}))),m.companies.map(function(e){return r.a.createElement(p,{key:e.id,company:e})})),r.a.createElement(j,null))}}))}),C=a(49),A=a(102),N=a(33),F=a(48),H=a(98),R=a(99),O=a(100),D=a(101),P=function(e){var t=e.id,a=e.name,n=e.picture,s=e.description,i=J();return r.a.createElement(H.a,{className:i.card,key:t},r.a.createElement(R.a,{style:{height:"100%"}},r.a.createElement(O.a,{image:n,style:{height:"300px",width:"100%"},title:a}),r.a.createElement(D.a,{style:{height:"100%"}},r.a.createElement(l.a,{gutterBottom:!0,variant:"h5",component:"h2"},a),r.a.createElement(l.a,{variant:"body2",color:"textSecondary",component:"p"},s))))},J=Object(w.a)({card:{margin:"10px",width:"300px"},grid:{display:"grid",gridGap:"10px",justifyItems:"center",gridTemplateColumns:"repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr))",gridAutoFlow:"dense",transition:"all 1s"},accordion:{backgroundColor:"#fdd7d3"}}),T=a(47),z=Object(o.a)({appHeader:{minHeight:"100vh",display:"flex",flexDirection:"column",alignItems:"center",fontize:"calc(10px + 2vmin)",color:"white"},app:{textAlign:"center"},grid:{display:"grid",gridGap:"10px",justifyItems:"center",gridTemplateColumns:"repeat(auto-fit, minmax(260px, 1fr))",gridAutoFlow:"dense",transition:"all 1s"},profileImage:{marginTop:"30vh",borderRadius:"50%",border:"4px solid #09f"}})(function(e){var t=e.classes;return r.a.createElement("div",{className:t.app},r.a.createElement(b,{component:function(){return r.a.createElement(r.a.Fragment,null,r.a.createElement(l.a,{color:"textPrimary",variant:"h1"},"3D Printing"),r.a.createElement("div",{className:t.grid},T.prints.map(function(e){return r.a.createElement(P,Object.assign({key:e.id},e))})))}}),r.a.createElement(j,null))}),G=Object(o.a)({appHeader:{minHeight:"100vh",display:"flex",flexDirection:"column",alignItems:"center",fontize:"calc(10px + 2vmin)",color:"white"},app:{textAlign:"center"},profileImage:{marginTop:"30vh",borderRadius:"50%",border:"4px solid #09f"},content:{whiteSpace:"pre-wrap",textAlign:"initial"},textArea:{padding:"20px"}})(function(e){var t=e.classes;return r.a.createElement("div",{className:t.app},r.a.createElement(b,{component:function(){return r.a.createElement(r.a.Fragment,null,r.a.createElement("header",{className:t.appHeader},r.a.createElement(p,{key:100,company:{id:100,label:"How to Fix Halo Infinite Sound Issues (Not a driver problem)"}},r.a.createElement("div",{className:t.textArea},r.a.createElement(l.a,{variant:"h2",className:t.content},"The Problem"),r.a.createElement(l.a,{className:t.content},"I had been playing Halo Infinite for about a month when it's crackling sound and no audio from either Halo Infinite or Discord started to plague me."),r.a.createElement(l.a,{className:t.content},"After fighting the problem for a week and finding no working solution online I finally came across a workaround that got me back to having audio in both Halo and Discord 100% of the time."),r.a.createElement(l.a,{variant:"h2",className:t.content},"The Fix"),r.a.createElement(l.a,{className:t.content})))))}}),r.a.createElement(j,null))}),L=Object(F.a)(),M=Object(C.a)({palette:{type:"dark"}});i.a.render(r.a.createElement(A.a,{theme:M},r.a.createElement(N.a,{history:L},r.a.createElement(E.d,null,r.a.createElement(E.b,{path:"/blog"},r.a.createElement(G,null)),r.a.createElement(E.b,{path:"/projects"},r.a.createElement(function(){return r.a.createElement(l.a,{variant:"h1"},"Projects")},null)),r.a.createElement(E.b,{path:"/3d-printing"},r.a.createElement(z,null)),r.a.createElement(E.b,{path:"/"},r.a.createElement(S,null))))),document.getElementById("root"))}},[[53,1,2]]]);
