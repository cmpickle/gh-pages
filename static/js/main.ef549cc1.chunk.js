The manual testing includes working with developers to make sure that all requirements are met for our user stories and to reduce/eliminate any bugs in the software. This involves exploratory testing, user driven testing, and edge case testing. With this testing I have learned what the user see and looks for when they are using the software along with the back end expertise of being able to configure the product and resolve issues when they arise.
