This framework will allow other testers with little to no experience with automation and programming to write automated tests with minimal training. This framework will allow for large automated suites that will be able to perform regression tests in a fraction of the time it would take a manual tester to complete as well as reduce the company's costs in manual testing time that the regression tests would take.\n\nI have also been working as a manual tester for Hyland, specializing in their Media testing. The manual testing includes working with developers to make sure that all requirements are met for our user stories and to reduce/eliminate any bugs in the software. This involves exploratory testing, user driven testing, and edge case testing. With this testing I have learned what the user see and looks for when they are using the software along with the back end expertise of being able to configure the product and resolve issues when they arise. This includes debugging based on error messages, constructing complex SQL queries to fix the database, and working with our team to solve any issues that we or the customer come across.",
