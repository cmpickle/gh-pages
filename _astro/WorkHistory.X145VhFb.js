This initiative significantly improved development velocity and ensured consistent user experiences across all platforms.

Led the complete rebuild of our Hospital platform from the ground up, successfully launching the entire platform with virtually zero bugs and seamless user transition. The platform migration was executed flawlessly with no negative impact to end users, despite representing a complete technological overhaul. The new platform has received overwhelmingly positive feedback from users, particularly praising the enhanced calendar view and thoughtfully implemented micro-animations that create an intuitive and delightful user experience.

Served as a technological leader within the team, mentoring peers and establishing development best practices that elevated code quality across projects. Provided technical guidance and problem-solving expertise to help team members overcome complex technical challenges, fostering a collaborative environment focused on continuous improvement and knowledge sharing.`},{id:6,name:"Gopuff",image:"/gopuff.jpg",position:"Software Engineer",timeline:"January 2022 - February 2024",technology:"Node JS, Typescript, Go, React, Azure, Docker, Kubernetes, Helm, Argo, postgres, cosmosdb",description:"I worked on building out the partner integrations between Gopuff and various partner vendors who want access to the Gopuff platform.

I then began work on a new team where I work with Vue on the front end and Go on the backend. I have led many team initiatives, dissecting the project and creating the technical documentation required for the team to begin work. After this project had two failed attempts by previous teams I was able to get the new team ramped up on the project and deliver the product within the required timeline.`},{id:4,name:"DealerSocket",image:"/dealersocket.webp",position:"Software Engineer II",timeline:"April 2018 - August 2019",technology:"C#, React, AngularJS, Java, AWS, Kafka, Docker, SQL Server",description:`I worked closely with the Front End architect to implement React Redux into our main Front End repository.

I have also been working as a manual tester for Hyland, specializing in their Media testing. The manual testing includes working with developers to make sure that all requirements are met for our user stories and to reduce/eliminate any bugs in the software. This involves exploratory testing, user driven testing, and edge case testing. With this testing I have learned what the user see and looks for when they are using the software along with the back end expertise of being able to configure the product and resolve issues when they arise.
